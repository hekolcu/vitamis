# Nutricode's Grand Vitamis Adventure 🚀
Welcome to the whimsical world of Nutricode, where bytes meet bites in a spectacular fusion of technology and nutrition! Our project, aptly named "Vitamis," is not just a software solution; it's a journey through the magical land of code and vitamins.

## The Enchanting Universe of Vitamis
Explore our mystical monorepo, where two legendary creatures coexist in harmony:

- The Backend Beast: Crafted with the mystical powers of ASP.NET Core 8, this web API is not your average backend. It's the silent guardian of our data, the watchful protector of our logic. It's the hero Nutricode deserves, but not the one it needs right now... or maybe it is?
- The Frontend Fairy: Fluttering through the forests of React and TypeScript, this dainty yet powerful being weaves the user interface with such elegance that even the elves would be envious.
## Journey to https://vitamis.hekolcu.com/
Embark on an epic quest to our digital domain, where the marvels of Vitamis await. Behold the splendor, bask in the glory, and maybe find a bug or two to keep things interesting.

### Remember, dear traveler:

In the land of Nutricode, every line of code matters.
Comments are like breadcrumbs; leave them for those who venture after you.
Beware of the merge conflicts; they are the dragons of our realm.
And lastly, enjoy the quest. For in Nutricode, we code not just with our keyboards, but with our hearts!
Happy coding, valiant Nutricoders! 🌟👩‍💻🧙‍♂️👨‍💻🌟
